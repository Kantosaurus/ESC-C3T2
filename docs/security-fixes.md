## Detailed Fixes

### 1. JWT Secret Security (Critical)

**Issue**: The JWT secret had a weak fallback value `"your_jwt_secret_here"` that could be exploited.

**Fix**:

- Added validation to require a secure JWT secret from environment variables
- Application now fails to start if CARELY_JWT_SECRET is not properly configured
- Added guidance to generate secure secrets using `openssl rand -base64 32`

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/backend/src/auth/secret.ts`

**Environment Variables Required**:

```env
CARELY_JWT_SECRET=<secure-random-string>
```

### 2. CORS Configuration (High)

**Issue**: When `ENABLE_CORS` was set, the application allowed requests from any origin (`cors()` with no options).

**Fix**:

- Replaced wildcard CORS with explicit origin validation
- Added URL validation for allowed origins
- Implemented proper CORS configuration with credentials support
- Added support for multiple origins via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/backend/src/misc/cors.ts`

**Environment Variables**:

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourapp.com,https://www.yourapp.com
```

### 3. Profile Picture XSS Prevention (High)

**Issue**: Profile pictures were processed as base64 without proper validation, potentially allowing XSS attacks.

**Fix**:

- Added client-side validation for file types, extensions, and sizes
- Implemented server-side validation using Zod schemas
- Restricted to JPEG format only after compression
- Added size limits (5MB upload, 2MB after compression)
- Validates base64 format and content

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/frontend/src/components/ui/profile-picture-upload.tsx`
- `packages/core/src/caregiver/caregiver.schema.ts`
- `packages/core/src/elder/elder.schema.ts`

### 4. Authorization Bypass (High)

**Issue**: The `/api/caregiver/:caregiver_id` endpoint allowed any authenticated user to access any caregiver's data.

**Fix**:

- Added authorization check to ensure users can only access their own caregiver profile
- Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access attempts

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/backend/src/caregiver/caregiver.handler.ts`

### 5. Sensitive Data Logging (Medium)

**Issue**: Console logs were exposing sensitive data including request bodies, user IDs, and database query results.

**Fix**:

- Removed all console.log statements that exposed sensitive data
- Kept only error logging for debugging (using console.error)
- Maintained general application flow logs without sensitive details

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/backend/src/elder/elder.handler.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/elder/elder.entity.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/caregiver/caregiver.handler.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/appointment/appointment.handler.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/appointment/appointment.entity.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/note/note.entity.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/dashboard/upcoming-appointments.handler.ts`

### 6. Payload Limits and Rate Limiting (Medium)

**Issue**: 10MB payload limits could enable DoS attacks, and there was no rate limiting.

**Fix**:

- Reduced JSON payload limit from 10MB to 2MB
- Reduced form data limit to 1MB
- Added parameter limit (100) to prevent parsing DoS
- Implemented rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes for general API, 10 requests per 15 minutes for auth endpoints
- Added content-length verification

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/backend/src/index.ts`

**Dependencies Added**:

- `express-rate-limit`

### 7. Open Redirect Prevention (Medium)

**Issue**: `FRONTEND_HOST` and `BASE_URL` environment variables were used in redirects without validation.

**Fix**:

- Created URL validation utility to prevent open redirect attacks
- Added protocol validation (only HTTP/HTTPS allowed)
- Implemented environment-specific validation (localhost for dev, configured hosts for production)
- Applied validation to all redirect scenarios

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/backend/src/misc/url-validation.ts` (new file)
- `packages/backend/src/auth/redirect.handler.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/elder/elder.handler.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/auth/singpass/auth-url.handler.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/auth/singpass/client.ts`

**Environment Variables**:

```env
ALLOWED_FRONTEND_HOSTS=yourapp.com,www.yourapp.com  # For production
FRONTEND_HOST=https://yourapp.com
BASE_URL=https://yourapp.com
```

### 8. Error Detail Exposure (Low)

**Issue**: Error details were being exposed to clients, potentially revealing internal system information.

**Fix**:

- Removed error detail exposure from AI handler responses
- Ensured all ZodError handling returns generic error messages
- Maintained internal error logging for debugging while hiding details from clients

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/backend/src/ai/ai.handler.ts`

### 9. Session Storage Security (Fixed)

**Issue**: Sessions were stored in an in-memory object, which is not suitable for production as it doesn't persist across server restarts and won't scale in multi-instance deployments.

**Fix**:

- Created database table for secure session storage with proper indexing
- Implemented session entity with CRUD operations for database-backed sessions
- Added automatic session expiry (1 hour default)
- Implemented periodic cleanup of expired sessions (every 15 minutes)
- Enhanced session cookies with security flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Added session management monitoring functions

**Files Modified**:

- `migrations/15_sessions.sql` (new file)
- `packages/backend/src/auth/session.entity.ts` (new file)
- `packages/backend/src/auth/session.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/auth/singpass/auth-url.handler.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/auth/redirect.handler.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/index.ts`

**Database Changes**:

- New `sessions` table with proper indexing for performance
- Automatic expiry timestamps
- Session data stored securely with encryption at rest (database level)

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- File uploads are strictly validated for type, size, and content
- URL parameters are validated and sanitized

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT tokens are properly verified
- Strong secret key enforcement
- Authorization checks on protected endpoints
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data removed from logs
- Error details hidden from clients
- Profile pictures processed and validated securely

### Network Security

- CORS properly configured with explicit origins
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
- Payload size limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Infrastructure Security

- URL validation prevents open redirects
- Environment variable validation
- Proper HTTP security headers via CORS configuration

## Environment Variables for Production

```env
# Required - Security Critical
CARELY_JWT_SECRET=<generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32>
SGID_CLIENT_ID=<your-sgid-client-id>
SGID_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-sgid-client-secret>
SGID_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-sgid-private-key>

# Required - Application URLs
FRONTEND_HOST=https://yourapp.com
BASE_URL=https://yourapp.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourapp.com,https://www.yourapp.com
ALLOWED_FRONTEND_HOSTS=yourapp.com,www.yourapp.com

# Optional - API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>

# Database
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=<your-postgres-connection-string>
```

## Testing Security Fixes

### Manual Testing

1. Verify JWT secret validation by starting app without CARELY_JWT_SECRET
2. Test CORS by attempting requests from unauthorized origins
3. Test file upload validation with malicious files
4. Verify authorization by attempting to access other users' data
5. Test rate limiting by making rapid requests

### Automated Testing

Consider implementing security tests for:

- Authentication bypass attempts
- CSRF protection
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS prevention

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Security Monitoring

- Monitor rate limiting triggers
- Log authentication failures
- Track unauthorized access attempts
- Monitor error rates for anomalies

### Regular Security Tasks

- Rotate JWT secrets periodically
- Update dependencies regularly
- Review logs for suspicious activity
- Conduct periodic security audits

## Post-Implementation Fixes

### 403 Error Resolution

After implementing the security fixes, a 403 error was discovered when creating new elders. This was resolved by:

- Adding proper error handling to the `insertElderHandler`
- Removing overly strict content-length verification from JSON middleware
- Adjusting rate limiting to be more generous in development environments

### Test Failures Resolution

The JWT secret validation security fix initially broke tests. This was resolved by:

- Making JWT secret validation environment-aware (allows test secrets in test mode)
- Updating test mocks to work with new database-backed session system
- Fixing async test expectations

See `docs/test-fixes.md` for detailed information about these fixes.

## Notes

All security fixes have been implemented without changing the core functionality of the web application. The fixes focus on preventing common web vulnerabilities while maintaining the existing user experience and feature set.

For production deployment, ensure all environment variables are properly configured and consider implementing additional security measures such as:

- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers middleware
- Database connection encryption
- Regular security scanning
- Intrusion detection systems
